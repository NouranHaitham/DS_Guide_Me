- **Graph Traversal:**
  - Traverse the country‚Äôs transportation graph using:
    - **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Ideal for finding the shortest path between cities.
    - **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Perfect for exploring all possible routes.
  - Simply input your starting city and choose your preferred algorithm.

- **Dynamic Map Management:**
  - **Update:** Modify existing transportation options between cities.
  - **Add:** Introduce new routes and transportation methods to the graph.
  - **Delete:** Remove outdated or unnecessary transportation options.

- **Completeness Check:**
  - Determine if the transportation map is fully connected, meaning every city is reachable from every other city.

- **Budget-Conscious Route Planning:**
  - Input your starting city, destination, and budget to receive a list of all available transportation options.
  - The results include the route (cities to pass through) and total cost, sorted in ascending order to help you make the best choice.

## üõ† Technical Highlights

- **Graph Representation:** 
  - The program reads map data from a file, representing cities and transportation options as a graph.
  
- **Data Structures:**
  - Utilized multiple data structures, including graphs, queues, and stacks, to efficiently manage and manipulate transportation data.
  
- **Algorithm Implementation:**
  - Implemented BFS and DFS to allow thorough exploration and pathfinding within the graph.

- **GUI:**
  - For an enhanced user experience, a graphical user interface can be integrated to make the application more user-friendly using QT.
